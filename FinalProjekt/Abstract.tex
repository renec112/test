This paper examines the behavior of the acousto optics effect, by using a 911 nm lasers and  an acousto-optic modulator(AOM). The behaviour of the light after modulation will greatly depend on the speed of sound within the AOM. It’s assumed this parameter isn’t unknown. To determine this parameter, with uncertainties, two different relations and approaches will be used. By using the relations from the $\theta_{sep}$ And simple measure of diffraction distance, we found that the speed is $v_s = ??$. By using the relations from rise/falltime with a switch and a modulator we found the the speed is $v_s = ??$. It’s assumed the results are reaching the true value for the speed of sound, but that the measurements and calculations contains errors and uncertainty.
